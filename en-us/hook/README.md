# Hook
"Hooks" is a real-time notification system mechanism that Botmarket implements on developers' websites. It initiates an HTTP request notification to the address set by the developer when a certain condition is triggered, which is convenient for developers to implement their own business logic.

Currently, the number of Hooks will gradually increase.
